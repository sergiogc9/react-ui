This package exports some utilities to be used together with the other React UI packages.

See more info about the library [HERE](https://github.com/sergiogc9/react-ui).

ℹ️ This library has been implemented by me and for me, hence it is highly opinionated.

## Usage

#### Installation

Install the package from npm or github packages:

```
yarn add -S @sergiogc9/react-ui-utils
```

#### Documentation

This package basically exports some utilities as util components or custom hooks.

Exported components:

- `Responsive`: Component to show or hide its children depending on the screen width and the defined breakpoints.

Exported custom hooks:

- `useBackdrop`: Custom hook that returns the current breakpoint.
- `useScreenSize`: Custom hook that returns the current breakpoint.
