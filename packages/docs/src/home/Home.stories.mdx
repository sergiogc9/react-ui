# Welcome

This repository contains a React UI library divided in some packages. The UI library is based on a **design system** using `React`, `styled-components`, `styled-system`, `storybook`, `lerna`, `typescript` and more.

ℹ️ The library is still in a beta stage as I am still migrating many components here.

ℹ️ This library has been implemented by me and for me, hence it is highly opinionated.

Packages:

- [`@sergiogc9/react-ui-theme`](/packages/theme):

  This package provides the theme and the Provider ready to use. The theme can be used as is or can be partially modified keeping the same structure (i.e. only changing values).

  A set of components ready to be used together with `styled-components`.
