# Modal

The Modal component show content on top of the page. You can use the `Header`, `Content`, `Footer` and `Close` namespaced components to easily layout the modal.

Each Modal is inserted inside a div with an id equal to `modals` that should be located outside the `root` div where React is mounted in. If the `modals` div is not found, the Modal is inserted as a `body` child.
If you don't want this approach, set the prop `withPortal` to false.

The `Modal.Header` component includes the `Modal.Close` button but you can use the `Modal.Close` standalone. It will be absoultelly positioned at top-right by default.

The modal visibility can be used **uncontrolled** or **controlled** from outside. To control its visibility from outside use the `isVisible` and `onClose` props.

## Sizes

You can change the Modal size using the `aspectSize` prop. From smaller to bigger:

<Canvas>
	<Story of={ModalMeta.Small} />
	<Story of={ModalMeta.Medium} />
	<Story of={ModalMeta.Large} />
	<Story of={ModalMeta.ExtraLarge} />
</Canvas>

## Overlay

The modal, by default uses a background Overlay behind it. You can disable it with the prop `withOverlay`:

With overlay:

<Canvas of={ModalMeta.WithOverlay} />

Without overlay:

<Canvas of={ModalMeta.WithoutOverlay} />

## Closing the modal

The modal, by default can be closed by clicking anywhere outside of it or pressing the `Escape` key. This can be disabled using the props `closeOnOutsideClick` and `closeOnEsc`:

Default closing behavior:

<Canvas of={ModalMeta.DefaultClose} />

Clicking outside closing behavior disabled:

<Canvas of={ModalMeta.OutsideClickDisabled} />

Pressing escape closing behavior disabled:

<Canvas of={ModalMeta.EscPressDisabled} />
