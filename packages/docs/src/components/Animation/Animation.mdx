# Animation

Animation is set of components and utils to help using animations in our styled-components based components. The main features are:

- You can use predefined animations or create custom ones.
- You can use these animations as a wrapper div or convert an existing component into an animation component.
- You can join different animations to be used one after each other, using the `Animate` component.
- You can start and stop animations using the `isEnabled` prop.
- You can show or hide the component using the `isVisible` prop. This is useful when you want to use the reverse animation before unmounting the component.
- Use different animation config for show and hide animations. Each animation prop has its own exit prop (e.g. `animationExit` or `durationExit`).
- You can avoid performing the animation at mount using the `animateAtMount` prop.

ℹ️ This components goal is to provide a easy way to use `animations` with `keyframes`. Sometimes it's easier to simply use `transitions` to achieve the same result.

## Start and stop the animation

Both BaseAnimation and Animate component comes with a `isEnabled` prop that tells the component to perform or not the animation. The expected behavior is:

- If false, no animation is performed.
- If true, the animation is started at mount.
- When changing to a falsy value, the animation is stopped and reset to the beggining.
- When changing to a truthy value, the animation is started again from the beggining.

ℹ️ This component stories have a "Restart animation" button that simply sets a false value and then it sets a true value after some milliseconds.

## Mounting and unmounting the component

Sometimes you want to performe a reverse animation when you want to remove the component (e.g. perform a FadeOut component if is shown with a FadeIn).

Using the `isVisible` prop you can tell to both BaseAnimation and Animate components when the component should be rendered or not.

To specify the remove animation, use the animation config props with the `Exit` suffix. If not using these props, the component will perform the animation or animations in the reverse direction. Once the exit animation finishes, the component is unmount.

The `isVisible` prop behavior is the following:

- If false, no component is rendered.
- If true, the component is rendered and the animation is started if `isEnabled` is not false.
- When changing to a falsy value, the component performs the exit animation(s) or the animation(s) in the reverse direction. Once they finish, the component is unmounted from the DOM.
- When changing to a truthy value, the component is rendered and the animation is started if `isEnabled` is not false.

ℹ️ You can test this behavior using the playground stories.

## BaseAnimation

The BaseAnimation is the base component used to create the animated components. It basically adds some css animation properties as component props (see API below).

### Pre-defined animations

This library includes some pre-defined animation components that uses the BaseAnimation inside. An example is the `FadeIn` component.

These pre-defined animations can be used as a component and, by default, they will use a div wrapper to perform the animation.
All the pre-defined components includes an animation `keyframes` object if you want to create a custom component using the pre-defined animation (see custom components below).

An example using FadeIn:


<Canvas of={AnimationMeta.FadeIn} />

You can try all available pre-defined animations selecting the story in the left sidebar.


### Overriding an existing component

The example above uses a wrapper div (i.e. a Box component). If you don't want this Box wrapper, you can create custom animation components using the HOC `withBaseAnimation`.

The returned component by the HOC will have all behaviors and props from `BaseAnimation`.

An example with the Button component and the FadeIn animation:

<Canvas of={AnimationMeta.WithCustomComponent} />

### Custom animations

You can create custom animations passing a keyframes object to the `withBaseAnimation`.

An example with a custom animation and the Button Component:

<Canvas of={AnimationMeta.WithCustomAnimation} />

## Animate

The Animate component lets to use more than one animation, one after each other. It has the same props as `BaseAnimation` but in an array format, where each index on it represents a unique animation.

For example, following the examples above, we can use the FadeIn and FadeOut pre-defined animations together with our custom animation:

<Canvas of={AnimationMeta.WithMultipleAnimations} />

### Overriding custom components

Euqal than with `BaseAnimation`, you can use the `withAnimate` HOC to convert an existing component into an `Animate` component, adding to it the behavior and props from Animate.

An example using the Button component:

<Canvas of={AnimationMeta.WithExistingComponentWithMultipleAnimations} />

## Animation List

Sometimes you want to animate elements inside a dynamic list (e.g. a table, accordeons, etc.). For these use cases, you can use the `Animation.List` component. The main features are:

- Animates its direct childs managing the `isVibile` prop for each child.
- Detects new elements in the list and animates them if needed.
- Detects removed elements keeping them into the DOM until the animation ends.
- Animate children provided at mount or not using the `animateAtMount` prop.

In order to make this component to work fine, there are some rules to follow:

- The children must be an array of `Animate` or `BaseAnimation` components. Custom components created with `withAnimate` or `withBaseAnimation` are also valid.
- As React guidelines says, each children must have an unique `key` prop. If not, strange behaviors can occur because the component will use index based keys.
- Don't specify the `isVisible` prop manually to children components. This is handled by the List component.
