# Overlay

The Overlay component is useful to keep the user out of focus from the page content to make him focus to another component (e.g. a modal, dialog, etc.).

Each overlay is inserted inside a div with an id equal to `overlays` that should be located outside the `root` div where React is mounted in. If the `overlays` div is not found, the overlay is inserted as a `body` child.

<Story name="playground" args={{ blur: 5 }} parameters={getPlaygroundStoryParams()}>
	{args => <OverlayPlaygroundStory {...args} />}
</Story>

<Canvas>
	<Story name="default" args={{}} parameters={getFixedStoryParams()}>
		{args => <OverlayDocsStory {...args} />}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

## Blur

You can use a blur effect to hide the content from the page passing a value to `blur` prop. It is a number representing the blur px used. If the `isVisible` prop is `false`, the blur effect is also disabled.

ðŸ›ˆ The blur effect can not be tested in the docs tab. Please test it using the playground story.
