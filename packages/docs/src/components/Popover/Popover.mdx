# Popover

This is a Popover component, helpful to show a Box content next to another component that acts as a trigger.

It is made with these components:

- **Popover**: The default exported namespaced component. It acts as a provider and it is a shortcut to all other components.
- **Trigger**: It acts as the trigger element which handles the trigger event to show and / or hide the popover content.
- **Content**: The popover content Box element shown when trigger event occurs.
- **Wrapper**: The component that handles the logic to show and hide the content, as well other stuff. It is based on the Tippy library.

**IMPORTANT**: Only use the `Popover.Wrapper` component to create a custom Popover content components (e.g. the `Popover.Content` and `Tooltip.Content` use it). If you want to use the default Popover content styling, use the Popover Content component.

## Timing

You can change the enter and exit timing using the `enterDelay` and `exitDelay` props:

<Canvas>
<Story of={PopoverMeta.EnterTiming}/>
<Story of={PopoverMeta.ExitTiming}/>

</Canvas>

## Interactive popover

By default, the popover is hidden when mousing out the trigger. This behavior can be changed using the `isInteractive` prop:

<Canvas>
<Story of={PopoverMeta.NotInteractive}/>
<Story of={PopoverMeta.Interactive}/>

</Canvas>

## Changing trigger event

By default, the popover is shown when hovering the trigger. You can change it using the `trigger` prop:

<Canvas>
<Story of={PopoverMeta.OnHover}/>
<Story of={PopoverMeta.OnClick}/>

</Canvas>

## Using without provider and trigger

You can use the popover without the provider and trigger, using the `reference` prop with the element that will act as the trigger.

<Canvas of={PopoverMeta.WithoutProvider} />

## Positioning

You can locate the popover in different places around the trigger component. See the `placement` prop for all values:

<Canvas of={PopoverMeta.Positioning} />
