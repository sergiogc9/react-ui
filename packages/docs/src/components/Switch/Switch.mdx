# Switch

A component used to render a Switch, wich would to toggle the state of a single item on or off.

<Canvas of={SwitchMeta.Playground} />

<Controls />

## AspectSize prop

The prop `aspectSize` can receive the values `s` or `m`.

Based on that value it changes the `width and height` styles of the Switch component.

All sizes icons:

<Canvas>
	<Story of={SwitchMeta.Small} />
	<Story of={SwitchMeta.Medium} />
</Canvas>

## Active state

By default, every switch has a `on/off` state and a `hover` that will change its colours and behaviour.

<Canvas of={SwitchMeta.Checked} />

## Disabled switch

You can disable it adding the `isDisabled` prop.

<Canvas of={SwitchMeta.Disabled} />

<ArgTypes of={Switch} />
