This package exports some components built with many components included in my React UI library based on a design system using `React`, `styled-components`, `styled-system` and more.

See more info about the library [HERE](https://github.com/sergiogc9/react-ui).

ℹ️ The library is still in a beta stage as I am still migrating many components here.

ℹ️ This library has been implemented by me and for me, hence it is highly opinionated.

## Usage

#### Installation

Install the package from npm or github packages:

```
yarn add -S @sergiogc9/react-ui-collections
```

Finally use any component from the UI library. These components must be used wrapped with the styled-components provider.

#### Documentation

This package basically exports all the components together with all their necessary types. For example, related to the `UserFeedback` component, it exports the component itself and its related props types: `UserFeedbackProps`.

In order to see the components docs, there is no public storybook available yet, but you can start it locally. All component are documented using the storybook.
